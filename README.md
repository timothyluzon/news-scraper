### News-Scraper-Project

*This work is based on previous work developed for a project at the University of Agder*

The aim of this project is to develop a web-scraper which gathers news headlines from Norwegian news sources.
Headlines are obtained from RSS-feeds, formatted in JSON, which are then to be unpacked for further use.
